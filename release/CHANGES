Current version is Rev.0.6.3

2010/07/10, v.0.6.3:
- Added Framework target for OSX
- Changed some ints to NSUInteger

2010/07/07, v.0.6.2:
- Removed asImage method in AFCache to get rid of UIKit dependency
- Removed assertion in cacheableItemFromCacheStore: that caused a termination of the running application when cache info store and
filesystem became out of sync. Now just logging the error (if AFCACHE_LOGGING_ENABLED). There are still be some circumstances that lead to discrepancies between
the filesystem and the cache info dictionary that seem to be software bugs, but they should not force a termination of the running program. TODO: observe the logs and try
find out what is causing the cache info store not to be written.
- Added Etag support.
- Added Demo target
- Added kHouskeepingInterval: housekeeping is only called every nth request
- Added script to create FAT library for simulator and iOS

2010/07/01. v.0.6.1:
- Added AFURLCache contribution by Nico Schmidt.
- Fixed several flaws when dealing with different combinations of http headers
- Added storeCachedResponse:forRequest: to AFURLCache. Not implemented yet, just checking if method is called for all requests. Unfortunately this method is NOT called for implicit requests, e.g. <img src="..."/>. Would be the ideal place to fill the cache.
- added housekeeping: in AFCache class which is called when saving the cache's state (via archive:)


2010/04/28: 
- Started versioning in with v.0.6.
- Transformed the classes into a static library and set up an Xcode Project
- Added unit tests for the following response types: 
	- with expire header
	- with max-age header
	- with out expire or max-age
	- with expire header, while switching the cache into offline mode and back	
- Added php script for use in unit tests
- Added AFCacheableItemInfo to hold requestTimestamp, responseTimestamp, serverDate, lastModified, age, maxAge, and expireDate
- Renamed expireDates dictionary in AFCache.m to cacheInfoStore
- cacheInfoStore now stores AFCacheableItemInfo objects instead of NSDate objects holding the expire date, which enables the correct use of AFCache.m's "isFresh:" method
- Removed some hacks for using the cache offline and introduced an "offline mode"
- Now doing an If-Modified-Since request if object is stale instead of doing a regular request which then might be canceled. Though we were not doing an additional request with the old method,
  packets were transferred through the network to be dropped by the kernel's tcp stack which costs unnessessary bandwidth.
- Introduced cacheStatus in AFCacheableItem to hold one of the following statuses: 	
	kCacheStatusNew: object is new, was not in cache before
	kCacheStatusFresh: object is delivered from cache
	kCacheStatusModified: object is in cache, but stale. An If-Modified-Since request was made to check the validity of the cached object. IMS request returns 200 (object has been modified).
	kCacheStatusNotModified: object is in cache, but stale. An If-Modified-Since request was made to check the validity of the cached object. IMS request returns 304 (object has NOT been modified).
	kCacheStatusRevalidationPending: used internally to determinate how to handle the status code of a pending request.
- cleaned up code and reformatted it
- Refactored NSDate+Parsing to DateParser because of Problems using categories from a static library in unit tests
- Added documentation
- Added CHANGES document

known issues
- synchronized requests are not testet well
- instead of using a php script for the server part, an integrated http server for unit testing might be better. Maybe also mock objects for NSResponse objects could do it.
