WHAT IS AFCACHE?
---
AFCache is an HTTP cache for use on iPhone/iPad and OSX.
It can be linked as a static library or as a framework.

Goals:

 - Build a fully RFC2616 compliant cache instead of doing simple time-based caching
 - Provide an offline mode to deliver content from cache when no network is available 
 - Provide a packaging mechanism to pre-populate the cache for accessing content offline
 - Allow caching of UIWebView resources by orverriding NSURLCache

CURRENT VERSION
---
0.6.5


HOW TO RUN THE UNIT TESTS
---
The unit tests currently depend on an existing HTTP-Server e.g. Apache. A simple php script
is provided to answer the requests properly. Put the script on your htdocs directory and
configure the URL in LogicTests.m, e.g.

static NSString *kBaseURL = @"http://127.0.0.1/~mic/afcache/";

For more information see CHANGES.

I am frequently using Charles as an HTTP debugging proxy which is superb for finding irregularities.
